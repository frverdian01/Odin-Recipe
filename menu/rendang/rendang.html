        <h2>What is rendang?</h2>
        <p>Rendang <i>(/ˈrəndɑːŋ/ REN-DUNG</i>; Indonesian pronunciation: [rənˈdaŋ]) is a Minang dish originating from the Minangkabau region in West Sumatra, Indonesia.[5] It has spread across Indonesian cuisine to the cuisines of neighbouring Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and the Philippines.[2] Rendang is often described as a rich dish of meat — most commonly beef (<i>rendang daging</i>) — that has been slow cooked and braised in a coconut milk seasoned with a herb and spice mixture,[6][7] until the liquids evaporate and the meat turns dark brown and tender, becoming caramelized and infused with rich flavours.</p>
